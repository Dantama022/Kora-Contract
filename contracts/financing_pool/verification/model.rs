// contracts/financing_pool/verification/model.rs
//!
//! Formal model of the `financing_pool` contract's core invariants.
//!
//! This module implements a **bounded exhaustive state-space model** of the
//! pool's state transitions.  It is not a mock or unit test — it enumerates
//! every reachable pool state within the configured bounds and asserts the
//! five core invariants on every state.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! - **I1 (Solvency):** `pool.balance >= sum(positions[i].contributed)` for
//!   all open pools; and `pool.balance >= 0` for all closed pools (the pool
//!   contract never goes negative).
//!
//! - **I2 (No double-payout):** For a closed pool, the total tokens disbursed
//!   to investors across the single `distribute_yield` call equals exactly
//!   `pool.repaid_amount`.  No investor receives yield a second time because
//!   the pool is marked `is_closed = true` before `distribute_yield` runs and
//!   the `RepaymentLock` prevents concurrent calls.
//!
//! - **I3 (Proportional yield-share):** Each investor's payout is
//!   `bps_of_normalized(repaid_amount, share_bps, TOKEN_DECIMALS)`.
//!   The sum of all payouts equals `repaid_amount` (possibly with dust
//!   credited to the first investor; see FINDING-V1 in README.md).
//!
//! - **I4 (Partial-repayment solvency):** After every partial repayment step
//!   the pool balance must remain >= `total_owed - repaid_amount` (the contract
//!   still holds enough to pay back what it owes).  Equivalently, each partial
//!   payout must be <= the remaining outstanding balance.
//!
//! - **I5 (No partial-repayment overpayment):** The cumulative `repaid_amount`
//!   across all partial repayment steps must never exceed `total_owed`.
//!   Equivalently, a partial repayment that would push `repaid_amount` above
//!   `total_owed` must be rejected, not silently capped.
//!
//! ## Simplifying assumptions
//!
//! See `README.md` §"Simplifying Assumptions" for the full list.  The most
//! important ones for reading this code:
//!
//! - Token decimals are fixed at 7 (USDC/EURC standard on Stellar).
//!   The multi-asset extension (I4_MULTI, I5_MULTI) adds a second decimal
//!   configuration to test the boundary where decimals differ across tokens.
//! - At most `MAX_INVESTORS` investors per pool.
//! - No cross-invoice netting, no installment schedules, no late penalties.
//! - `share_bps` values are computed from `contributed * 10_000 / total_pool`
//!   exactly as the contract does.
